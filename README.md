Kotlin mobile quiz application.
Loosely inspired by flag quiz by Deitel & Associates Inc.  

Quiz is made of 15 questions of Japanese characters.
User can select between: Hiragana, Katakana or Kanji (level N5)
By default Hiragana is selected.
Additionally user can change the number of buttons with possible answers between 2 - 8.
Above can be adjusted in the Settings and will be remembered by the device. 

The project uses Firebase Firestore as the database for the signs used in the quiz.
